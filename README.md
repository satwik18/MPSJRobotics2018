# MPSJ Autonomous Robotics 2017/2018

This is the repository for the MPSJ Autonomous robot code, but if your reading this you already know that.

To setup the codebase on your computer, follow [these instructions](https://www.tetrixrobotics.com/prizmdownloads). This repository already contains the library, so you do not need to download that if you have cloned (or will) this project.
